<h3>More on the book</h3>

Given the popularity of self-help books these days, and the shallow, manic knowledge most of these contain, we might today read *The Book of Disengagements* as a tonic for all sorts of New Age fads and desperate grasping after identity. In aiming first at the dissolution of the self, in its refusal to have anything to do with any ideologies at all, this is a book that goes several steps further than shelves full of self-improvement tomes. It is a book that is free of clutter; there is no scenery, no social commentary, nothing to mark it as a work of a certain time and place. Perhaps for that reason it seems as relevant to our age and its preoccupations as it must have seemed to turn-of-the-century readers in Montevideo and elsewhere. It was apparently republished in Buenos Aires in the 1920s but I have not been able to track down that edition, which must have had a very small print run.

The Book of Disengagements begins with 10 rules that serve as a framework for the rest of the ideas and images advanced in the work. These rules, in effect, condense all the rest of the text; but the "variations on a theme" that make up the bulk of the book are its true treasure. The restrained verve, cerebral effervescence, and quiet humor of all Q.B.'s sentences are worth the occasional redundancy.
