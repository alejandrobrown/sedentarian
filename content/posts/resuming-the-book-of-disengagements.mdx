I’ve been meaning for years now to translate the contents of an anonymous manuscript, which I’ve written about elsewhere, called the *The Book of Disengagements*. 

The self-published book, its spine broken, was given to me by a writer I used to know when I was doing my expat thing in Buenos Aires in the 2000s. Let’s call him M. He’s still alive, eventually he left Argentina for New York, I think. All I know is his internet presence is scant, so I’m not sure he’d want to be named. In any case, M claimed to have found this tome in the used book market in downtown Montevideo, Uruguay, and was translating it into English. It was the work of a certain anonymous author, who wrote in the 19th Century. 

Here’s how M described the book, a description I’d be pained to improve on, he also goes on to state his intention to translate the book. 

>*The Book of Disengagements* a difficult to classify book of aphorisms, off-the-cuff metaphysics and meditative writing. Like Fernando Pessoa's *The Book of Disquiet* it is not so much a book as an anti-book, formless; it is also a user's manual to life that constantly undermines its own utility.

>It is thought to have been written by a late 19th Century Uruguayan intellectual, but all we know of his or her identity are the initials, "Q.B." The book experienced a short spurt of popularity in early 20th Century Uruguay, but soon faded into obscurity. The author's identity has never been revealed.

>I found an old copy at the famous blocks-long Tristan Narvaja street fair in Montevideo in early 2005, and after a couple of years spent with the book and savoring its odd tone, have decided to translate all of it, little by little. 

But M was a dissolute and unreliable sort. The last time I saw him he had shaved his head and planned to take a train journey to Misiones province, to visit the ruins of the Jesuit Empire, perhaps inspired by the book’s vein of vaguely Christian-inflected mysticism, but who knows.

M managed to publish a few excerpts online in 2007. Google will even tell you a bit about it in a “snippet,”based on obscure lit mags and blogs that picked up M’s fragmentary translations.

After a few months, he lost interest, as I said, and entrusted it to me. I shoved it in a box and forgot about it. 

Without a daily regimen, I doubt that I’ll manage to render the manuscript tractable and legible. It is a *yerba mate* and mildew-stained thing. 

I’ll use the tools below to aid me on this journey. I am usually unable to do anything, anything at all, without an intellectual framework to support me, and an app to fiddle with.

Wish me luck, translation is a tricky thing and I’ve always thought this book a work of genius. Here’s one of the entries previously translated by M.

## Entry #4

> Writing is an untangling of the mind knot, and once it is untangled, a gesture: the ribbon is allowed to float away and twist and turn in the wind.
